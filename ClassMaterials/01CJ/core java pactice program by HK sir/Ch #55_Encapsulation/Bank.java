//in above program we have used try/catch 
	//1. for catching the exception thrown from setBalance() method
	//2. for stop terminating main method execution abnormally and
	//3. for dispalying error message on console in user understand way

//we also used e.getMessage() method, it is a predefined method available in
//IllegalArgumentException class. It reads and returns the error message available 
//in this exception object that is caught by catch block

//we used while loop for reexecuting the same code, when wrong values are passed
//in side loop we used break, for terminating loop, when correct value passed
