==================================================================
01. What is software or a project, why project?
	- A collection of programs as one group is called a software or a project 
	
	- A project is used for performing business operations 
	  by a computer in an automated way 

02. What is the meaning of manual operation and automation operation?
	- Performing mathematical calculation by a human and 
	  storing data in a books by a human is called manual operation 

	- Performing mathematical calculations by a computer and 
	  storing data in the computer by a software 
	  is called automation operation 

03. What are the advantages of automation?
	1. A business can run 24/7 365 days without holidays
	2. We can have good relation with the customer , 
	   because software will not scold customer  
	3. We can get secured, accurate and fast transactions    
	4. We can always have safe data backup
   
    For example:
       - Compare Bank application, mobile recharge application,
         Movie, Bus and train ticket booking application,
	 buying vegetables from supermarket and from roadside shop, 
	 without software and with software automation.
	 
04. What is a programming Lanaguage and why PL?
     - A programming language is a communication media between 
       a programmer and a computer. By using a programming language 
       a programmer writes a program, gives it to the computer 
       to perform one operation. 		

     - A programming language provides 'syntaxes and a semantics' 
       to develop a program to perform mathematical operations 
       by using computer.
       
05. What is a program and Why a program?      
     - A program is a sequence of statements 
       placed as a one group with a proper name 
       
     - A program is used for instructing the computer 
       to perform one operation.
       
     - This operation can be a mathematical operations 
       like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc...
       
     - or can be business object operations
       like deposit, withdraw, bookTicket, rechargeMobile, applyForLoan, etc...

06. What are the different activities we perform as part one operation?
     - As part of every operation we will perform five of five activities 
	1. Reading values and storing in the program 
	2. Performing validations and calculations  
	3. Controlling flow of execution  
	4. Throwing exceptions, if a given values are wrong 
	5. Printing output and error message 
       
07. What are the programming concepts to perform above activties?       
       - In every Object-Oriented Programming Language 
         We have below 5 concepts to perform above five activities 
		1. Data types and variables 
		2. Operators 
		3. Control flow statements  
		4. Exception handling statements 
		5. Print statement 

08. What are langauge fundamenals and what are those?
	- A programming concept that is used for developing logic 
	  to perform one operation is called language fundamental.
	  
	- The programming concepts data types, operators, CFSs, EHs
	  are called language fundamentals
	  
	=====================================================================
	 Language Fundamentals	  Purpose  
	=====================================================================
	 1. DTs and Vars	-> for storing data
	 
	 2. Operators		-> for performing Vals and Cals		
	 
	 3. CFS stmts		-> for controlling flow execution 
				   for taking decision which block of 
				   statements must execute and must not execute
				   
	 4. EH Stmts		-> for throwing exceptions with an error message 	 			    
	                           when wrong values are passed.
	====================================================================
	
09. Steps to build a logic to perform one opertion?	
	- Every operation logic development comes under 4 steps
