===================================================================================

1. What is an inheritance?
	- Inheritnace is one of the OOP principles	

	- It is a Parent-Child relation
			  Parent 

		Child1    Child2   Child3


	- The process of creating a new class/object 
	  deriving from an existing class/object 
	  is called inheritance.
	
	- For example:  
	  class A { }
	  class B extends A{ } //here we are deriving 
	                    //class B from class A
		//then class B is called sub type of class A

	- class A is called Super class or Parent class Or Base class
	- clss B  is called Sub class or Child class or Derived class

2. Why inheritance?
	- for obtaining the type, properties and behaviors of 
	  one class/object to another class/object
	  to treat new classes as sub type of an existing classes
	  we will develop inheritance
	  
	- For example  
		- for creating Student as Person type
		- for creating Lion    as Animal type
		- for creating Bus     as Vehicle type
	   we must develop inheritance
	   
	- As part of inherintace we will develop
	  child classes or sub type classes of an 
	  existing class or object.

3. When must we develop inheritance?
   we will develop inheritance in the below two situations
	1. for extending or implementing existing class 
	   functionality by adding new properties and 
	   new behviours in new class as sub type
	   we will develop inheritance.
	   
	   - For example:
		class Person { String name;}
		class Student extends Person{ String course;}
		
		- for adding more properties and behaviors to 
		  Person we will extend Person class
	  
	2. for creating new multiple objects of same type
	   as one group for achieving code reusability and
	   loose coupling between sub type objects and user object
	   we will develop inheritance.
	   
	     - For example: without inheritance
		class Person { }	here all these 4 objects	
		class Student { }	are individual objects	
		class Faculty { }	not same type of objects
		class Admin { }
	   
	     - with inheritance we can create Student, Faculty and Admin
	       objects as same type of objects Person
	     
		class Person { }	
		class Student extends Person{ }	
		class Faculty extends Person{ }		
		class Admin   extends Person{ }	

4. How can we develop inheritance?
	- by using the keywords
		1. extends 
		2. implements

	- For deriving a class from an interface 
	  we must use implements keyword
	   for example:
	   	interface Example { }
		class Sample implements Example{ }

	- For deriving a class from a class or 
	  for deriving an interface from an interface
	  we must use extends keyword
	   for example:
		class A { }
		class B extends A { }

		interface I1 { }
		interface I2 extends I1 { }
		class C implements I2 { }

 5. Sample program and execution flow
	//Example.java 
	class Example {
	   static int a = 10;
	   int x = 20;
	}

     //====================================================
	//Sample.java 
	class Sample {

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Example e1 = new Example(); //HAS-A relation
			System.out.println(e1.a);
			System.out.println(e1.x);
		}
	}
     //====================================================
	//Sample.java
	class Sample extends Example {	//IS-A relation
                                  
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Sample s1 = new Sample(); //accessing with IS-A relation
			System.out.println(s1.a);
			System.out.println(s1.x);
		}
	    
	}

6. Sample project on OOP Basics, Encapsulation and Inheritance 
	- The main purpose of inheritance is 
	  extending and reusing exising class/object 
	  functionality as sub type 
	  
Inheritance and types of inheritance
=======================================
Q) Identify are below objects' classes creation correct or wrong design
	class Student {}	wrong design

	class Lion {}		wrong design

	class HDFCBank {}	wrong design

	class Rectangle {}	wrong design

	class Airtel {}		wrong design

becuase all above objects are not main or individual objects
the above all objects are sub types of other main or individual objects
so we must create above classes as sub type but not as individual objects 
//====================================================================

below code shows creating above objects as sub types 
by developing inheritance by using 'extends and implement' keywords
	class Person { }
	class Student extends Person{ }		//correct desing

	interface Animal { }
	class Lion implements Animal { }	//correct desing

	class Bank { }
	class HDFCBank extends Bank { }		//correct desing

	interface Shape { }
	class Rectangle implements Shape { }	//correct desing

	interface Sim { }
	class Airtel implements Sim { }		//correct desing
//========================================================================

Q) How many ways we can reusing existing class members in new class?
A) in 2 ways	
	1. by using HAS-A relation (Association)
	2. by using IS-A relation (Inheritance)

	- HAS-A relation means 
		creating existing class object in new class
		and accessing members by using the existing class object
	
	- IS-A relation	means
		creating new class deriving from an existing class
		and accessing existing class members by using this new class object

- Below code explains access Person class members in Student class for Person object
  with HAS-A relation( Person class members are not executing for Student object)

	class Person {
		Sting name;

		void eat() {
			System.out.println(name + " is eating");
		}
	}
//=====================================================================

	class Student {  
		public static void main(String[] args) {
		  //=== HAS-A === realation wise reusing
			Person p1 = new Person();//Student class is reusing
			p1.name = "Hari";	//Person class and its memebers
			p1.eat();		//for perform operation for Person
		}
	}
	//with HAS-A relation we are reusing 
	//Person and its members for Person but not student

	//for using Person members for Student, 
	//we must develop IS-A realtion(Inheritance)

	//By developing inheritance we are 
	//'extending and reusing' existing class members
	//for new class object as if those existing members
	//available in this new class
//=====================================================================

	class Student extends Person { //extending Person to use as Student

		public static void main(String[] args) {
		  //reusing with IS-A relation	
			Student s1 = new Student();	
			s1.name = "hari";	//we are accessing and reusing
			s1.eat();		//existing class Person members
						//as if those are own members of 
		}				//Student object 
	}


	//Inheritance is meant for 'extending + resuing'
//=====================================================================

//Q) Can we store one class object in another class type referenced variable?
//A) If this object's class is SUB CLASS, we can store

//Identify CE in the below program?

	class Animal { }
	class Lion { }

	class Test {
	   public static void main(String[] args) {

		Animal a1 = new Animal();	//allowed, same type
		Lion   l1 = new Lion();		//allowed, same type

		//Animal a2 = new Lion();	//not allowed, not IS-A relation
		Person p1 = new Student();	//allowd, Student IS-A Person type

	   }
	}

//when we develop inheritance, 
	the new type object/class obtains the existing object/class 
	  'type, properites and behaviors' and 
	this new object is considered as
	existing class object type.

//hence we can stored the sub type object
	//1. either in its own type referenced variable
	//2. or     in its super type referenced variable

	Student s1 = new Student(); //same type referenced variable, allowed
	Person  p1 = new Student(); //super type referenced variable, allowed

//but we can not store Super class object in sub class type variable	
	Student s2 = new Person(); //not allowed, 
			//sub type refernced variable with super type object

//concusion: 
 - The object type class(RIGHT side class) 
    must be same or sub type class of variable type class(LEFT side)

	A a1  = new B();

	class B must be sub class of class A
	else we will get CE: incompatible types
