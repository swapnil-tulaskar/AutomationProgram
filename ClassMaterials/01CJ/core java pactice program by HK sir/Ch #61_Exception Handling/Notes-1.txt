Exception Handling
==============================================================
1. What is an exception?
	1. runtime error
	2. it is an object 
	3. which is an instance of Throwable 
	   or one of its sub classes

2. Why exception?
	1. for terminating program abnormally

3. When does an exception occure?
	1 because of wrong values or wrong logic 

4. What happend when an exception raised?
	1. program execution is terminated abnormally
	2. JVM displays complete information about this exception

5. What is the information an exception object contan?	  
	the exception information contains
		1. Thread name
		2. Exception classname
		3. Reason for the exception
		4. place of the exception

6. How can we solve an exception?
	- either by changing values
	  or by changing logic

7. Who will pass values to the program?
	- end-user

8. Then who must change values, when wrong values are passed?
	- end-user

9. Can end-user understand the exception message printed by JVM
   to solve exception by passing corret values?
	- No

10. Then what we do in the program?
	- we must handle this exception
	 to print user understandable message
	 
11. What is exception handling?
	- the process of catching or reporting the exception 
	  to this method caller is called exception handling

12. Why exception handling?
	1. to stop abnormal termination
	2. to print user understandable message
	3. to execute alternative logic

13. What are the keywords used in Exception handling?
	1. try/catch -> for catching exception
	2. thorws    -> for reporting exception to this method caller

14. What are the total number of keywords using this chapter?
	In total we will use 5 keywords
		1. try
		2. catch
		3. finally
		4. throw
		5. throws

15. What is the need of try and catch?
   
	try	-> is a block that allows us to place 
		   exception causing statements and its
		   dependent statements
	    
	catch	-> is a parameterized block it is used for
	           catching an exception that is thrown from
		   the body of corresponding try statement

16. Syntax for using try,catch?
		void m1(){
		   ------	
		   ------	normal statements	
		   ------	
		   try {	
			   ---
			   ---	exeption causing statements
			   ---  and their dependent statements
		   }	
		   catch(SomeException1 e1) {
			   ---
			   ---  SomeException1 handling logic
			   ---	  either message printing or
			   ---    alterative logic
		   }
		   catch(SomeException2 e2) {
			   ---
			   ---  SomeException2 handling logic
			   ---	  either message printing or
			   ---    alterative logic
		   }
		   ----
		   ----	normal logic
		   ----
		}
