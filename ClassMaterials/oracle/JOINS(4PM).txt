JOINS: (28-08-2024)
======
	- In RDBMS data can be stored in multiple tables.From those multiple tables 
if we want to retrieve the required data / information then we use a technique is 
known as "JOINS".
	- Joins are used to retrieving data / information from multiple tables at a time.
	- Oracle supports the following two types of joins those are,
		1) NON-ANSI JOINS(oracle8i joins)
		=============================
			- Equi join
			- Non-Equi join
			- Self join

		2) ANSI JOINS(oracle9I joins)
		=========================
			- Inner join
			- Outer join
				- Left outer join
				- Right outer join
				- Full outer join
			- Cross join
			- Natural join

Note:
=====
	- ANSI joins are portability joins whereas NON-ANSI joins are not a portability 
joins.Here portability is nothing but to move a join statement from one platform to 
another platform without any changes.

syntax for NON-ANSI joins:
=======================
SELECT * FROM <TN1>,<TN2> WHERE <joining condition>;

syntax for ANSI joins:
===================
SELECT * FROM <TN1> <join key> <TN2> ON <joining condition>;

i) Equi join / Inner join:
===================
	- when we are retrieving data from multiple tables based on an " = " operator
condition is known as equi join / inner join.
	- when we use equi join we should have at least one commoness colmn in
both tables.
	- when we want to join two or more than two table there is no need to have 
relationship between tables.Here relationship is optional.
	- it always retrieve matching rows from multiple tables.

syntax for joining condition:
========================
NON-ANSI format:
================
where <table name1/table alias name1>.<common column name> = <table name2 / table alias name2>.<common column name>;

ANSI format:
===========
on <table name1/table alias name1>.<common column name> = <table name2 / table alias name2>.<common column name>;

DEMO_TABLES:
==============
SQL> SELECT * FROM COURSE;

      1024 MILLER

EX:
waq to retrieve student and the corresponding course details from the tables?
NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT,COURSE WHERE STUDENT.CID=COURSE.CID;
			(OR)
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S,COURSE C WHERE S.CID=C.CID;

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT INNER JOIN COURSE ON STUDENT.CID=COURSE.CID;
			(OR)
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S INNER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

RULE FOR JOINS:
===============
	===================================================
	|| a row in a table is comparing with all rows of another table ||
	===================================================

Ex:
waq to retrieve student and their selected course details from the tables.if the course 
name is "ORACLE"?
NON-ANSI
SQL> SELECT SNAME,CNAME FROM STUDENT S,COURSE C WHERE S.CID=C.CID AND CNAME='ORACLE';

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT SNAME,CNAME FROM STUDENT S INNER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID AND CNAME='ORACLE';
			(OR)
SQL> SELECT SNAME,CNAME FROM STUDENT S INNER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID WHERE CNAME='ORACLE';

Ex:
waq to display employees who are working under "CHICAGO" location from emp,dept tables?
NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT ENAME,LOC FROM EMP E,DEPT D
  2  WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO AND LOC='CHICAGO';

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT ENAME,LOC FROM EMP E INNER JOIN DEPT D
  2  ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO AND LOC='CHICAGO';

Ex:
waq to display sum of salaries of each department name wise from emp,dept tables?
NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E ,
  2  DEPT D WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME;

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E INNER JOIN
  2  DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME;

Ex:
waq to display DEPTNO,sum of salaries of each DNAME wise from emp,dept tables?
NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT D.DEPTNO,DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E ,
  2  DEPT D WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY D.DEPTNO,DNAME;

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT D.DEPTNO,DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E INNER JOIN
  2  DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY D.DEPTNO,DNAME;

Ex:
waq to display sum of salary of department names from emp,dept tables if the sum of
salary of the department is less than 10000?
NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E ,
  2  DEPT D WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME HAVING SUM(SAL)<10000;

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT DNAME,SUM(SAL) FROM EMP E INNER JOIN
  2  DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME HAVING SUM(SAL)<10000;

Ex:
waq to display no.of employees working under department names from emp,dept tables
in which department the no.of employees are working more than 3?
NON-ANSI
SQL> SELECT DNAME,COUNT(*) FROM EMP E,DEPT D
  2  WHERE E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME
  3  HAVING COUNT(*)>3;

ANSI
SQL> SELECT DNAME,COUNT(*) FROM EMP E INNER JOIN DEPT D
  2  ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO GROUP BY DNAME
  3  HAVING COUNT(*)>3;

29-08-2024:
==========
OUTER JOINS:
============
	- these are again three types.

i) Left outer join:
==============
	- retrieving matching rows from both tables and unmatching rows from the left
side table only.
ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S LEFT OUTER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

NON-ANSI:
=========
	- when we want to implement outer joins in non-ansi format then we use 
a join operator is (+).

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S,COURSE C WHERE S.CID=C.CID(+);

ii) Right outer join:
==============
	- retrieving matching rows from both tables and unmatching rows from the right
side table only.
ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S RIGHT OUTER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S,COURSE C WHERE S.CID(+)=C.CID;

iii) Full outer join:
==============
	- it is a combination of left outer and right outer join.
	- by using full outer join we will retrieve matching rows and unmatching rows from 
the tables at a time.
ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S FULL OUTER JOIN COURSE C ON S.CID=C.CID;

NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S,COURSE C WHERE S.CID=C.CID(+)
          UNION
          SELECT * FROM STUDENT S,COURSE C WHERE S.CID(+)=C.CID;

NON-EQUI JOIN:
==============
	- retrieving data from multiple table based on any operator condition except an " = "
operator.

DEMO_TABLES:
=============
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1;

       SNO NAME
---------- ----------
         1 SMITH
         2 ALLEN

SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST2;

       SNO    SAL
---------- 	----------
         1      23000
         3      34000

EX:
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1 T1,TEST2 T2 WHERE T1.SNO>T2.SNO;
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1 T1,TEST2 T2 WHERE T1.SNO>=T2.SNO;
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1 T1,TEST2 T2 WHERE T1.SNO<T2.SNO;
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1 T1,TEST2 T2 WHERE T1.SNO<=T2.SNO;
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST1 T1,TEST2 T2 WHERE T1.SNO!=T2.SNO;

EX:
waq to display employees whose salary is between low salary and high salary?
NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL,LOSAL,HISAL FROM EMP,SALGRADE
  2  WHERE SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL;

ANSI:
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL,LOSAL,HISAL FROM EMP JOIN SALGRADE
  2  ON SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL;

		(OR)
NON-ANSI
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL,LOSAL,HISAL FROM EMP,SALGRADE
  2  WHERE (SAL>=LOSAL) AND (SAL<=HISAL);

ANSI
SQL> SELECT ENAME,SAL,LOSAL,HISAL FROM EMP JOIN SALGRADE
  2   ON (SAL>=LOSAL) AND (SAL<=HISAL);

CROSS JOIN:
===========
	- joining two or more than two tables without any condition.
	- in cross join mechanism each row of a table will joins with each row of 
another table.For example a table is having (m) no.of rows and another table is having(n)
no.of rows then the result is (mxn) rows.

EX:
ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT CROSS JOIN COURSE;

NON-ANSI:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT,COURSE;

DEMO_TABLES:
=============
SQL> SELECT * FROM ITEMS1;

       SNO    INAME           PRICE
      ---------- ----------              ----------
         1 PIZZA                   180
         2 BURGER                85

SQL> SELECT * FROM ITEMS2;

       SNO INAME           PRICE
      ---------- ----------          ----------
        11 PEPSI              25
        12 COCACOLA      20

SQL> SELECT I1.INAME,I1.PRICE,I2.INAME,I2.PRICE,
  2  I1.PRICE+I2.PRICE AS TOTAL_AMOUNT FROM
  3  ITEMS1 I1 CROSS JOIN ITEMS2 I2;

NATURAL JOIN:
=============
	- retrieving matching rows from multiple tables based on an " = " operator
with a common column name just like equi join.

	Natural joins			Equi join
	===========			=========
1. this join condition is preparing 		1. this join condition is preparing 
by system implicitly.			by user explicitly.

2. here common column name is 		2. here common column name is 
    mandatory.				optional.

3. to avoid duplicate columns from		3. it will not avoid duplicate columns
 the result automatically.			from the result automatically.

Ex:
SQL> SELECT * FROM STUDENT S NATURAL JOIN COURSE C ;

SELF JOIN:
=========
	- joining a table by itself is known as "self join".
			(or)
	- comparing a table data by itself is also caled as "self join".
	- self join can be implemented based on a single table only.
	- when we use self join we must create alias names on a table otherwise 
	we cannot implement self join technique.
	- when we create alias name on a table internally system will prepare a virtual 
	table on each alias name.
	- we can create any no.of alias names on a single table but each alias name
	should be different.
	- self join can be used in two cases in database.
		Case-1: Comparing a single column values by itself with in the table.
		Case-2: Comparing two different columns values to each other with in the table.

Examples on comparing a single column values by itself with in the table:
=============================================================
Ex:
waq to display employees who are working in the same location where the employee
SMITH is also working?

DEMO_TABLE:
============
SQL> SELECT * FROM TEST;

ENAME      LOC
---------- 	----------
SMITH       HYD
ADAMS      MUMBAI
JONES       CHENNAI
MILLER      HYD
MARTIN     DELHI

Solution:
========
SQL> SELECT T1.ENAME,T1.LOC FROM TEST T1,TEST T2
  2  WHERE T1.LOC=T2.LOC AND T2.ENAME='SMITH';
