Local object , current object, argument object 
=====================================================================
- An object that is created inside a method or block or constructor 
  by assigning it to a local reference variable we call it as local object 
  
  For example:
	void m1() {
	   Example e1 = new Example();
	    //local	   //local object	
	    //refernced      
	    //variable
	}

- An object using which we call as non-static method or constructor 
  is called current object
  
   For example: 
	void m1() {
	   Example e1 = new Example(); //local object w.r.t to m1() method	
	   
	   e1.m2();  //the same e1 object is CO w.r.t to m2() method	
	}
	void m2() {
	
	}
  
- An object that is passed as input or argument to a method
  is called argument object
  
    For example:
	void m1() {
	  Example e1 = new Example(); //LO w.r.t m1()
	  e1.m2();		      //CO w.r.t m2()
	  m3(e1);		      //AO w.r.t m3()
	}

	void m2() { }
	
	void m3(Example e){ }

Always we create objects inside main method or some other user defined methods, 
further to perform different operations on those objects
we share/pass those objects to other user defined static and non-static methods.

To a static method, we can pass object only in one way as argument   
To a non-static method, we can pass object in two ways 
	either as current object or as argument object or as both 

Always CO is passed as first argument 
       AO is passed as second argument 
		e1.m1(e2); |-> e1 is CO, passed as first argument
			   |-> e2 is AO, passed as second argument
			
Inside the method 
	1. CO is received and stored in this keyword 
	2. AO is received and stored in parameter

Inside this called method
	1. To read and modify non-static variables values
	   from CO, we must access them either
	   directly by their name or by using this keyword
	   
	2. To read and modify non-static variables values
	   from AO, we must access them by using parameter
	   
Below program explains all above points

 class Example {			class Test {
   int x = 10;				  public static void main(String[] args) { 
						
   static void m1(Example e) {			Example e1 = new Eaxample();
						
						Example.m1(e1);
   }						
	  
   void m2() {					Example e2 = new Example();
	   
						e2.m2();
   }						
	   
   void m3(Example e) {				e1.m3(e2);  //CO->e1, AO->e2
						
						e2.m3(e1);  //no CE, CO->e2, Ao->e1
   }						e1.m3(e1);  //no CE, CO and AO ->e1
						e2.m3(e2);  //no CE, CO and AO ->e2	
}					     }
					}	


To receive both CO and AO, the method must be a non-static method
and it must have parameter of class type

If we modify CO or AO data inside this called method,
those modification are effected to calling method.

it means, after method execution inside calling method
if we read object data by using the orginal referenced variable 
we will get the called method modified values

What is the output from below program?
