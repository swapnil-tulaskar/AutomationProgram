public class IdentifierRules {
	/*
	1. Identifier can contain only
	    letters, digits,SCs
	      a-z     0-9     $ _
	      A-Z

	2. Identifier can not starts with a digit, a digit can used from second character onwrds

	3. Identifer can not contains special characters other than $ and _

	4. Identfier can not have space in between words. if need use space, connect them by using _. Hence _ is called connector symbol

	5. Identifier is case sensitive (a!=A)

	6. We can not use keywords or reserved words identifiers. But we can use predefined classname, variable name, methods names as user defiend identifiers, because they can differentiated by using package name and class name.

	7. From Java 9v onwards we can not use single '_' 
	   as identifier, because from java 9v onwards 
	   it is a keyword

	Note: Like in C language, in Java there is no limitation on identifier length
	      we can use any number of characters, but it is not recommanded, because
		  it different to remember and access.
