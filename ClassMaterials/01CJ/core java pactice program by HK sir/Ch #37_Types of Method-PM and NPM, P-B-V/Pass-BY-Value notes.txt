Does Java support Pass-By-Reference?
===============================================================================
Controversary question, because there are different answers for this question
some blogs say supports and some other blogs say does not support. 

So I refered SunMicrosystems Java tutorials, they said Java supports 
only Pass-By-Value

In sun microsystems tutorial, I found, 
	"Even though object is passed as arugment, 
	 it comes under pass-by-value, because after method complete,
         the pass-in refenrenced variable still points the same old object. ".  
 
It means, when we pass a primitive value or an object to a method as argument,
and if we modify them in method parameter by assingning new value or new object, 
that modification is not effected to the passed-in variable.

   But they mentioned, if we modify object data by using method paramter that modification is effected 
   to passed in referenced variable, becasue both pass-in referenced variable and parameter are pointing 
   to same object memory.

Programitically we can conclude three points	 	
	1. if we pass primitive value as argument, and if we midify it in parameter,
			that modification is not effected to passed-in variable

	2. if we pass object as argument, and if we midify parameter by assigning new object,
			that modification is not effected to pass-in referenced variable 
			it means after method execution completed, the passed-in variable is still refers 
			the same object that is refering before method call 

	3. if we pass object as argument, and if we modify object data by using parameter,
			that modification is effected to pass-in referenced variable 
			it means after method execution completed, the passed-in variable will get 
			method parameter modified values
