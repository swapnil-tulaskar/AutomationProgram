Object oriented programming basics revision with a project 
======================================================================
1. The OOP is one programming paradigm or a methodology or a technique.

2. It provides set of suggestions 
   1. for creating RWO in PW
   2. by providing security to object data and 
   3. by providing dynamic binding between objects communication 

3. OOP is meant for developing business applications 

4. For developing real world object in the programming world and to achieve 
   security to object data and dynamic binding between objects communication 
   OOP provides 9 concepts 

   	1. class
	2. object

	3. encapsulation
	4. inheritance
	5. polymorphism
	6. abstraction

	7. message passing
	8. loose coupling
	9. runtime polymorphism

5. A programming language that provides syntaxes, semantics and programming 
   concepts for creating RWO in PW by implementing above OOP concepts 
   that programming language is called Object Oriented Programming language.
   
   For example: Java, C#.net, Python, PHP are OOP languages 
	
6. Java provides below 8 programming elements for creating RWO in PW and 
   for implementing above 9 OOP concepts

	1. module	-> for grouping packages

	2. pacakge	-> for grouping classes

	3. class	-> for representing an object and 
			   for for grouping variables and methods	

	4. variables	-> for representing values and 
			   for providing memory for storing values

	5. methods	-> for representing operation and 
			   for implementing logic to perform this operation

	6. constructors	-> for initializing object instance fileds

	7. blocks	-> for initializing static and instance fileds
			   common to all constructors

	8. inner classes-> for representing inner object of an outer object

7. In a project we must create 
	1. Multiple classes based on multiple different type of objects 

	2. Multiple variables based on multiple values or objects we need to store 

	3. Multiple methods based on multiple different operations we need to perform  


8. The main target of OOP is creating RWO in PW 
   which is belongs to the current business application 

9. For creating RWO in PW, we must consider below 
    characteristics of an object	for example
   	1. object type			-> [Student]	, [Employee]	
   	2. object state			-> [sno, sname] , [eno, ename]
   	3. object behaviour		-> [listen(),..], [work(), ...]
   	4. object identity		-> [sno]	, [eno]
   	5. individial objects of this type->[hk, bk,...], [hk, bk,...]

10. For creating RWO in PW we must follow below steps
