===================================================================================

1. What is an inheritance?
	- Inheritnace is one of the OOP principles	

	- It is a Parent-Child relation
			  Parent 

		Child1    Child2   Child3


	- The process of creating a new class/object 
	  deriving from an existing class/object 
	  is called inheritance.
	
	- For example:  
	  class A { }
	  class B extends A{ } //here we are deriving 
	                    //class B from class A
		//then class B is called sub type of class A

	- class A is called Super class or Parent class Or Base class
	- clss B  is called Sub class or Child class or Derived class

2. Why inheritance?
	- for obtaining the type, properties and behaviors of 
	  one class/object to another class/object
	  to treat new classes as sub type of an existing classes
	  we will develop inheritance
	  
	- For example  
		- for creating Student as Person type
		- for creating Lion    as Animal type
		- for creating Bus     as Vehicle type
	   we must develop inheritance
	   
	- As part of inherintace we will develop
	  child classes or sub type classes of an 
	  existing class or object.

3. When must we develop inheritance?
   we will develop inheritance in the below two situations
	1. for extending or implementing existing class 
	   functionality by adding new properties and 
	   new behviours in new class as sub type
	   we will develop inheritance.
	   
	   - For example:
		class Person { String name;}
		class Student extends Person{ String course;}
		
		- for adding more properties and behaviors to 
		  Person we will extend Person class
	  
	2. for creating new multiple objects of same type
	   as one group for achieving code reusability and
	   loose coupling between sub type objects and user object
	   we will develop inheritance.
	   
	     - For example: without inheritance
		class Person { }	here all these 4 objects	
		class Student { }	are individual objects	
		class Faculty { }	not same type of objects
		class Admin { }
	   
	     - with inheritance we can create Student, Faculty and Admin
	       objects as same type of objects Person
	     
		class Person { }	
		class Student extends Person{ }	
		class Faculty extends Person{ }		
		class Admin   extends Person{ }	

4. How can we develop inheritance?
	- by using the keywords
		1. extends 
		2. implements

	- For deriving a class from an interface 
	  we must use implements keyword
	   for example:
	   	interface Example { }
		class Sample implements Example{ }

	- For deriving a class from a class or 
	  for deriving an interface from an interface
	  we must use extends keyword
	   for example:
		class A { }
		class B extends A { }

		interface I1 { }
		interface I2 extends I1 { }
		class C implements I2 { }

 5. Sample program and execution flow
	//Example.java 
	class Example {
	   static int a = 10;
	   int x = 20;
	}

     //====================================================
	//Sample.java 
	class Sample {

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Example e1 = new Example(); //HAS-A relation
			System.out.println(e1.a);
			System.out.println(e1.x);
		}
	}
     //====================================================
	//Sample.java
	class Sample extends Example {	//IS-A relation
                                  
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Sample s1 = new Sample(); //accessing with IS-A relation
			System.out.println(s1.a);
			System.out.println(s1.x);
		}
	    
	}

6. Sample project on OOP Basics, Encapsulation and Inheritance 
	- The main purpose of inheritance is 
	  extending and reusing exising class/object 
	  functionality as sub type
